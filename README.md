# Technical Report: Automated Detection of Social Engineering Frauds on Social Media Platforms

---

## 1. Introduction

#### Overview of Social Engineering Frauds
Social engineering frauds involve the manipulation of individuals into divulging confidential information or transferring money to fraudsters. On social media platforms, these frauds often take the form of fake accounts impersonating prominent individuals. These accounts exploit the trust and influence of well-known personalities to deceive users.

#### Prevalence and Impact
- **Prevalence**: According to a 2022 report by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), losses due to social media scams exceeded $770 million, with impersonation scams being one of the most common tactics.
- **Impact**: These frauds not only cause financial losses but also damage the reputation of the impersonated individuals and erode user trust in social media platforms.

#### Real-World Data
- **Data Source**: The dataset used for this report is sourced from Kaggle ([Fake Social Media Account Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamamir/fake-social-media-account-detection/input?select=fake_account__data_dict.csv), [Instagram Fake Spammer Genuine Accounts](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamamir/fake-social-media-account-detection/input?select=train.csv))
 and GitHub ([Social Media Fake Account Detection](https://github.com/Vinod-Ghanchi/Social-Media-Fake-Account-Detection)).
- **Dataset Description**: The dataset includes features such as account creation date, follower-to-following ratio, posting frequency, profile completeness, and account activity patterns.

### Table: Dataset Overview

The dataset used for fake social media account detection comprises various features that help distinguish between genuine and fake accounts. The primary features include:

- **Status Count**: The total number of posts or statuses an account has made.
- **Followers Count**: The number of users following the account.
- **Friends Count**: The number of users the account is following.
- **Favorites Count**: The number of posts the account has marked as favorites.
- **Listed Count**: The number of public lists that include the account.
- **Language**: The primary language used by the account.
- **Name**: The display name of the account.

The target variable is the 'fake' column, where a value of 1 indicates a fake account, and 0 denotes a genuine account. This dataset is structured to facilitate binary classification tasks aimed at identifying fake social media profiles.


| Feature               | Description                                      | Data Type  |

## 2. Problem Overview


#### Tactics Used by Fraudsters
Fraudsters employ several tactics to create convincing fake accounts:
1. **Profile Cloning**: Copying profile pictures, bios, and posts from legitimate accounts.
2. **Name Spoofing**: Using slight variations of prominent individuals' names (e.g., "Elon Musk" vs. "Elon Muskk").
3. **Follower Manipulation**: Purchasing fake followers to appear credible.
4. **Content Mimicry**: Reposting content from the impersonated individual to appear authentic.
5. **Social Proof**: Engaging with other users to build trust and legitimacy.

#### Challenges for Social Media Platforms
1. **Volume of Data**: Social media platforms host billions of accounts, making manual detection infeasible.
2. **Evolving Tactics**: Fraudsters continuously adapt their methods to evade detection.
3. **False Positives/Negatives**: Misclassifying legitimate accounts as fraudulent or vice versa can harm user trust.
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Automated systems must balance fraud detection with user privacy and data protection.

## 3. Objectives


#### Define Primary Goals
The proposed solution aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. **Real-Time Detection**: Identify and flag fraudulent accounts as soon as they are created.
2. **Minimize False Positives/Negatives**: Ensure high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and fake accounts.
3. **Scalability**: Handle the vast volume of accounts on social media platforms.
4. **User Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

#### Real-World Data and Justification
- **Real-Time Detection**: According to a 2021 study, 60% of fraudulent accounts engage in malicious activities within the first 24 hours of creation. Real-time detection is crucial to mitigate damage.
- **Minimize False Positives/Negatives**: A high false positive rate can lead to legitimate accounts being wrongly flagged, causing user dissatisfaction. Conversely, a high false negative rate allows fraudulent accounts to operate undetected.
- **Scalability**: Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter host billions of accounts, necessitating a scalable solution.
- **User Privacy**: Compliance with regulations like GDPR ensures user trust and avoids legal repercussions.
